The Transliminal Earth Alliance Metanarrative (T.E.A.M.) is a transcendent, emergent distributed activism narrative paradigm of which we are all a part. The TEAM cluster listed here is a specific community which grew out of [/r/sorceryofthespectacle](http://reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle) on reddit.

Since March 2015, the TEAM has been working to coalesce and network together various activism movements by constructing, discovering, and articulating peer-to-peer protocols that can describe decentralized community functioning. There are currently three main systems in the TEAM: The check-in cel system, which is a trading card game used to get to know each other and create consistent network activity; a guilds system, which helps to organize collective activity into useful shared projects; and the Coalition of Invisible Colleges (CIC) itself, which is a fruit of the TEAM's internetworking protocols.
