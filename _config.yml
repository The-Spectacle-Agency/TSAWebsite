# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  The Spectacle Agency is a cooperative organization dedicated to connecting 
  all of the most critical projects and activists together. We intend to clearly 
  justify the work that needs to be done in mobilizing an effective response to 
  the problems which now confront humanity on a global scale. This website serves 
  as a concentration point for the finest organizations, projects, and people who 
  are currently engaged in this historic effort, so that they may be better served 
  in their service to humanity.
