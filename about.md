The CIC is a tactfully depolitical organization. The CIC is technically not an organization at all, but merely a directory. What does it mean to be listed in the directory of the Coalition of Invisible Colleges? Merely that you are listed in the directory.

The directory is well-organized, considering the nature of its content. By juxtaposing similar communities and similar strata of distinct communities, conversation is started amongst the different groups. This encourages cultural cross-pollination, leading to better understanding and higher alignment amongst the individuals who make up those groups of people, many of whom belong to multiple meta-organizations at various scales and with qualitatively different aims or contexts.
