The Directory Do-op indexes the activities of all other do-ops, so it's easy to see what everyone else is working on, and how that work combines holopticistically (synarchically). This reduces duplication of effort, creates new connections and cross-pollination, and makes all projects more accessible to newcomers (the directory is a rapid onboarding interface).
