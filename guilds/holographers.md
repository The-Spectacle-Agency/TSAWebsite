When a photograph is cut in half, you get two very different photographs. When a hologram is cut in half, you get two identical holograms. This is analogous to the difference between closed hierarchical organizational models and open network organizational models. The hierarchy enables a centralized state, while the network enables stateless decentralization. Asymmetric protocols form hierarchy, where each individual has a superior, and potentially subordinates.

Holographers create symmetric protocols, which form networks between autonomous peers.
