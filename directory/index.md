The directory is the heart of the Coalition of Invisible Colleges. By indexing the various functions, aspects, and subcommunities of the various communities connected in the CIC network, we can promote collaboration and sharing of spaces, resources, and information. This is the base Jekyll theme.

Here is a current list of confirmed CIC member colleges:

* [The Metacurrency Project (Ceptr)](/ceptr/)
* The T.E.A.M. (Transliminal Earth Alliance Metanarrative)
* Fringechan.org
