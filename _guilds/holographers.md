When a photograph is cut in half, you get two very different photographs. When a hologram is cut in half, you get two identical holograms. This is analogous to the difference between closed hierarchical organizaional models and open network organizational models. The hierarchy enables a centralized state, while the network enables stateless decentralization. Asymmetric protocols form hierarchy, where each individual has a superior, due to imbalances of information, and centraliation of power. Holographers create symmetric protocols, which form networks between autonomous peers.

A guild system carves out the various motivations for human activity and serves as a context for the creation and flow of protocols across organizations. One of the most fundamental guilds of the TEAM, the Holographers' Guild discovers, articulates, develops, and refines the protocols which underlie the stigmergic functioning of the blockchain illuminati.

Holographers bring noncommunicative opposites into communication with each other, bridging schisms or prejudicial divides in communication through the formulation and discovery of new protocols which offer meta-perspectival views to all who adopt them. In this capacity, hologragraphers act as social alchemists.
