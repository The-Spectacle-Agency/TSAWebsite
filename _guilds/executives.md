Welcome to the Executive's Guild!  

Traditional hierarchical organizations utilize a management tree to execute centralized authority. With peer to peer network based organizations, each individual must be an autonomous executive to some extent.  

Executives maintain a situational awareness to make informed decisions and strategies. They also cultivate the means to expression of will. 

Executives like nothing more than slack, and will accomplish the greatest feats with the smallest effort. Executives take care to manage the material viability of projects they undertake, and to protect from loss.
