Wizards are generally concerned with three things:

1. Knowledge and the teaching of correct knowledgeâ€”ontology, epistemology, metaphyisics, science, and alchemy
2. Ethics
3. Putting things into groups of threes

Therefore, the Wizards' Guild helps to organize activity related to basic magico-religious knowledge, the teaching of this knowledge in a high-quality and empowering manner, and the numerological and symbolic correspondence-systems which help to tame the imagination and make its expanses navigable.
