Hackers are concerned with providing the best tools possible for personal sovereignty and social liberation. Hackers know that "information wants to be free", aligning closely with [Librarians](/guilds/librarians/) in this respect. Hackers are interested in cutting-edge ways that technology can be deployed for freedom, citing BitNation, post-blockchain technologies, personal cryptography, decentralized meshnets, open-source genomics, and other such atomizing developments.
