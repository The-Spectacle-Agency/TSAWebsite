**Overview**:

When a photograph is cut in half, you get two very different photographs. When a hologram is cut in half, you get two identical holograms. This is analogous to the difference between closed hierarchical organizaional models and open network organizational models. The hierarchy enables a centralized state, while the network enables stateless decentralization. Asymmetric protocols form hierarchy, where each individual has a superior, and potentially subbordinates.
Holographers create symmetric protocols, which form networks between autonomous peers.

**Form Of Joy**:  

 * Joy in finding peers who have been working on the same project as you all along  
 * Joy in connecting with transcendent principles and articulating a shared vision without ideological or ethical conflict  
 * Joy in verifying one's faith in transcendence experimentally  

**Form Of Suffering**:  

 * Suffering due to being disconnected from other people with similar intent  
 * Suffering due to lack of vision and agreement upon this vision  
 * Suffering due to confusion and disagreement about which social problems are real, how their boundaries are defined, and what actions might be most effective in remedying them
