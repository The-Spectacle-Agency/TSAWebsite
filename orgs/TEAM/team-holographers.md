**Form Of Joy**:  

 * Joy in finding peers who have been working on the same project as you all along  
 * Joy in connecting with transcendent principles and articulating a shared vision without ideological or ethical conflict  
 * Joy in verifying one's faith in transcendence experimentally  

**Form Of Suffering**:  

 * Suffering due to being disconnected from other people with similar intent  
 * Suffering due to lack of vision and agreement upon this vision  
 * Suffering due to confusion and disagreement about which social problems are real, how their boundaries are defined, and what actions might be most effective in remedying them  

**Approach**:  

Articulating peer-to-peer protocols that can describe decentralized community functioning.
