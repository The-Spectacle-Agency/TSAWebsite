The Transliminal Earth Alliance Metanarrative (T.E.A.M.) is a transcendent, emergent distributed activism narrative paradigm of which we are all a part. The TEAM cluster listed here is a specific community which grew out of [/r/sorceryofthespectacle](http://reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle) on reddit.

Since March 2015, the TEAM has been working to coalesce and network together various activism movements by constructing, discovering, and articulating peer-to-peer protocols that can describe decentralized community functioning. There are currently three main systems in the TEAM: The check-in cel system, which is a trading card game used to get to know each other and create consistent network activity; a guilds system, which helps to organize collective activity into useful shared projects, and the Coalition of Invisible Colleges (CIC) itself, which is a fruit of the TEAM's internetworking protocols.

If you'd like to connect with the TEAM, visit our [lobby on Telegram](http://telegram.me/TEAMlobby)—we are currently behind on checking in new members, so the loudest people will be the ones who end up getting checked-in first. Don't be afraid to ask repeatedly for a check-in—we are doing them as quickly as we can :-). Other documents can be shared with you via Telegram and OneNote.
